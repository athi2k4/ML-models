## Introduction
This project showcases two machine learning models:
1. **Age Predictor**: A CNN model that predicts the age of a person from an image.
2. **Basic Shapes Generator**: A GAN model that generates basic shapes such as circles, squares, and triangles.

As my first attempt at creating machine learning models, it was exciting to see them work and produce meaningful results!

## Features
- **Age Predictor**:
  - Predicts age from an input image.
  - Trained on a dataset of facial images with age labels.
- **Basic Shapes Generator**:
  - Generates images of basic shapes.
  - Utilizes a GAN architecture to learn and produce shapes.

## Installation
To run the models, you need to have Python installed along with some essential libraries. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
-Age Predictor
1.Ensure you have the necessary dataset for training and testing.
2.Train the CNN model using the dataset.
3.Predict the age of a new image.


-Shapes Generator
1.Ensure you have the dataset for training the GAN.
2.Train the GAN model.
3.Generate new shapes.
